### Hi there!

My name is Emircan Tepe and I am a junior year computer engineering student at Dokuz Eyl√ºl University. I am interested in machine learning and back-end development.

You can find several repositories of projects I have worked on or am currently working on in my profile. Also, you can reach my CV by clicking [here](https://tepeemircan.com/assets/files/tepe-emircan-cv.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 

I am always open to collaborating on new projects if it will help me improve my skills in these areas I shared above. 

If you would like to get in touch with me, you can reach me via email at [e-mail](mailto:emircan.tepe@ceng.deu.edu.tr), or through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emircantepe/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emircan_tepe1).
